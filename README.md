## Solving equations

If you want to use prepared user interface you have to call `quadratic_solver`. If you don't need it, you can use functions `solve_quad_eq` and `solve_linear_eq` (detailed description of how to use them read documentation).

## Unit tests

To execute unit tests include `"unit_tests.h"` and call `unit_tests`. 

## Documentation

For more detailed information see documentation in [folder docs](https://github.com/vian96/quadratic_equation_c/tree/main/docs).
